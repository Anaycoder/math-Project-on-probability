<h2>What is Probability</h2>
<br>
<h2>In common usage, the word "probability" is used to mean the chance that a particular event (or set of events) will occur expressed on a linear scale from 0 (impossibility) to 1 (certainty), also expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100%. The analysis of events governed by probability is called statistics.</h2>
<br>
<h2>Where is probability used and how ?</h2>
<br>
<h4>Weather forecasting: Before planning for an outing or a picnic, we always check the weather forecast. Suppose it says that there is a 70% chance that rain may occur. Do you ever wonder from where this 70% come from? Meteorologists use a specific tool and technique to predict the weather forecast. They look at all the other historical database of the days, which have similar characteristics of temperature, humidity, and pressure, etc. And determine that on 70 out of 100 similar days in the past, it had rained.

    Medical Decisions – When a patient is advised to undergo surgery, they often want to know the success rate of the operation which is nothing but a probability rate. Based on the same the patient takes a decision whether or not to go ahead with the same.
    
    Politics: Many politics analysts use the tactics of probability to predict the outcome of the election’s results. For example, they may predict a certain political party to come into power; based on the results of exit polls.
    
    Sports: To decide what are the chances of winning or losing of a particular team based on their previous record. Similarly, the probability is put to use in order to devise the sports strategy also. For instance, by tracking the record of a batsman in cricket, it is decided at what place or rank, he should play.
    
    Typing on Smart Devices: When we type, the software constantly keeps suggesting words. It does this using probability- depending on which word is now commonly used.
    
    Insurance Policies: When we get anything insured, we study which insurance policy would be appropriate depending on our usage of the thing and/or what are the chances of damage and what kind of recovery is possible.</h4>

    <h2>Theoritical Probability</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Theoretical probability is probability that is determined on the basis of reasoning. Experimental probability is probability that is determined on the basis of the results of an experiment repeated many times. Probability is a value between (and including) zero and one.</h2>

<h2>Experimental probability is probability that is determined on the basis of the results of an experiment repeated many times. Probability is a value between (and including) zero and one.</h2>

<h1>Experiment on dices results</h1>


<h2>5/12 chnce of getting a six </h2>

<h2>Theoritical Probability</h2>
<H2>In theoritical probability we will have 1/6 chance of getting a six </H2>
<h2>so now you can see the difference clearly but it could be other way round and there could aalso be 0 sixes after 12 chances in Experimental probability</h2>
